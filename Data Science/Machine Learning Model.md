## Regression

Regression is a statistical method that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable and a series of other variables. 

### Â Simple Linear Regression
$\color {teal} y=ax+b$
parameter: intercept, slope
$x$ is called feature
$y$ is called label

### Multivariable Regression
$y=a_1x+a_2x+a_3x+...a_nx+b$
$SSE(sum\ of\ square\ of\ error)=\sum(y_i-f_i)^2$
$SST(total\ sum\ of\ squares)=\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2$
$R^2= 1-\frac{SSE}{SST}$
